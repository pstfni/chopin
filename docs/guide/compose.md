## How to compose your playlist

You can configure your own playlist with a YAML file. First, you can give your playlist a `name`, a `description`, and a number of songs (`nb_songs`).
Several subsections are available to use different sources to customize a playlist. Take the following example:

```yaml title="A composition configuration example"
name: "Energy"
description: "Playlist for working out"
nb_songs: 16
playlists:
  - name: rock
  - name: electro
artists:
  - name: Queen
  - name: Kraftwerk
```

Give your YAML configuration to the entrypoint:

<div class="termy">
```console
$ compose --composition-config playlist_composition.yaml
```
</div>

A playlist titled "Energy" will be added to your Spotify library. It will have 16 songs:

- 4 from one of your playlist named 'rock'
- 4 from another one of your playlist, 'electro'
- 4 songs by Queen
- and 4 Kraftwerk songs.

See the [sources](sources.md) for all the available sources and their options.

## Use weights to balance your playlist

All sources of your playlists have a `weight` attribute. For your running playlist, you may want
more "rock" songs than "electro" ones.

The `weight` attribute can be used to ponder items. All weights will be normalized, and used to compute the number of
songs per item in your final playlist.

```yaml title="A composition configuration, with weights"
name: "Running"
description: "Playlist for working  out"
nb_songs: 200
playlists:
  - name: rock
    weight: 1
  - name: electro
    weight: 0.5
artists:
  - name: Queen
  - name: Kraftwerk
    weight: 0.5
```

Your new "Running" playlist will have 200 songs:

- 67 from your 'rock' playlist
- 34 from 'electro'
- 67 songs by Queen
- and 34 by Kraftwerk.

## Use `release_range` to filter tracks by their release date

The `release_range` option let you configure a date range for the tracks you want in your playlist.

```yaml title="A playlist for this year releases" hl_lines="9"
name: "Releases of the year"
nb_songs: 100
playlists:
  - name: pop
  - name: rock
artists:
  - name: Bleachers
  - name: Fontaines D.C.
release_range: ["01/01/2023", ]
```
