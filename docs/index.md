Welcome to chopin, the Spotify playlist manager.

### What is Chopin ?

chopin is a user-friendly CLI to compose Spotify playlists from various sources.

It also comes with commands to manage your playlists.

    On November 2024, Spotify removed - without notice, seven API routes. 
    
    Unfortunately, most of chopin's features have since been downsized to the minimum feature set allowed by Spotify.
