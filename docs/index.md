# Chopin

Welcome to Chopin, the Spotify Playlist manager.

### What is Chopin ?

Chopin is a user-friendly CLI to compose Spotify playlists from various sources.

It also comes with entrypoints to manage your playlists.

    On November 2024, Spotify removed - without notice, seven API routes. Unfortunately, chopin's features have since been downsized to the 
    minimum feature set allowed by Spotify. 

### Available features

Several entrypoints come with the chopin repository:
